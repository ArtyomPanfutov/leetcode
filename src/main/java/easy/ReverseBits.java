/**
 * 190. Reverse Bits
 * Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * Note that in some languages such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
 * In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 2 above, the input represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the signed integer -1073741825.
 * Follow up:
 *
 * If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
