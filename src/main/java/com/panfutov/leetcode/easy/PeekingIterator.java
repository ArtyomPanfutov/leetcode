/**
 * Given an Iterator class interface with methods: next() and hasNext(), design and implement a PeekingIterator that support the peek() operation -- it essentially peek() at the element that will be returned by the next call to next().
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * Assume that the iterator is initialized to the beginning of the list: [1,2,3].
 * <p>
 * Call next() gets you 1, the first element in the list.
 * Now you call peek() and it returns 2, the next element. Calling next() after that still return 2.
 * You call next() the final time and it returns 3, the last element.
 * Calling hasNext() after that should return false.
 * Follow up: How would you extend your design to be generic and work with all types, not just integer?
